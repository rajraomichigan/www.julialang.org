One of the main foci of development during Julia 1.6 has been to reduce *latency*, the delay between starting your session and getting useful work done.  This is sometimes called "time to first plot," although it applies to far more than just plotting.
While a lot of work (and success) has gone into reducing latency in Julia 1.6, users and developers will naturally want even more.  This is the inaugural post in a short series devoted to the topic of what package developers can do to reduce latency for their users.  This particular installment covers background material that will hopefully be useful in later installments.

**NOTE**: Fixme!

## Sources of latency, and reducing it with `precompile`

Most of Julia's latency is due to *code loading* and *compilation*. Julia's dynamic nature also makes it vulnerable to *invalidation* and the subsequent need to recompile previously-compiled code; this topic has been covered in a previous [blog post][invalidation], and that material will not be rehashed here.  In this series, it is assumed that invalidations are not a dominant source of latency.  (You do not need to read the previous blog post to understand this one.)

In very rough terms, `using SomePkg` loads the method definitions, after which calling `SomePkg.f(args...)` forces `SomePkg.f` to be compiled (if it hasn't been already) for the specific types in `args...`.  The primary focus of this series is to explore the opportunity to reduce the cost of compilation.  We'll focus a lot on *precompilation*,

```
julia> using SomePkg
[ Info: Precompiling SomePkg [12345678-abcd-9876-efab-1234abcd5e6f]
```

during which Julia writes module, type, and method definitions in an efficient [serialized] form.
While all this happens nearly automatically, with a bit of manual intervention developers also have an opportunity to save some of the results of compilation to the file, specifically the *type inference* stage of compilation.
Because type inference takes time, this can reduce the latency for the first use of methods in the package.

To motivate this series, let's start with a simple example. We define a package in a few lines (thanks to Julia's metaprogramming capabilities) that depends on very little external code but still has fairly long latency. Being aware that the following will create a package directory `DemoPkg` inside your current directory, you can copy/paste the following into Julia's REPL (note that `(@v1.6) pkg>` indicates [package mode]):

```
(@v1.6) pkg> generate DemoPkg
  Generating  project DemoPkg:
    DemoPkg/Project.toml
    DemoPkg/src/DemoPkg.jl

julia> typedefs = join(["struct DemoType$i <: AbstractDemoType x::Int end; DemoType$i(d::AbstractDemoType) = DemoType$i(d.x)" for i = 0:1000], '\n');

julia> codeblock = join(["    d = DemoType$i(d)" for i = 1:1000], '\n')

julia> open("DemoPkg/src/DemoPkg.jl", "w") do io
           write(io, """
           module DemoPkg

           abstract type AbstractDemoType end
           $typedefs

           function f(x)
               d = DemoType0(x)
               $codeblock
               return d
           end

           end
           """)
       end
```

(After executing this, you can open the `DemoPkg.jl` file to see what `f` actually looks like.) If we load the package, the first call `DemoPkg.f(2)` takes some time:

```
julia> push!(LOAD_PATH, "DemoPkg/");

julia> using DemoPkg

julia> tstart = time(); DemoPkg.f(2); tend=time(); tend-tstart
0.28725290298461914
```

but the second one (in the same session) is much faster:

```
julia> tstart = time(); DemoPkg.f(5); tend=time(); tend-tstart
0.0007619857788085938
```

The extra cost for the first invocation is the time spent compiling the method. We can save some of this time by *precompiling* it and saving the result to disk.  All we need to do is add a single line to the module definition, `precompile(f, (Int,))`:

```
julia> open("DemoPkg/src/DemoPkg.jl", "w") do io
           write(io, """
           module DemoPkg

           abstract type AbstractDemoType end
           $typedefs

           function f(x)
               d = DemoType0(x)
               $codeblock
               return d
           end

           precompile(f, (Int,))            # THE CRUCIAL ADDITION!

           end
           """)
       end
```

Now start a fresh session, load the package (you'll need that `push!(LOAD_PATH, "DemoPkg/")` again), and time it:

```
julia> tstart = time(); DemoPkg.f(5); tend=time(); tend-tstart
0.056242942810058594

julia> tstart = time(); DemoPkg.f(5); tend=time(); tend-tstart
0.0007371902465820312
```

It doesn't eliminate all the latency, but at just one-fifth of the original this is a major improvement in responsivity.  The fraction of compilation time it saves depends on the balance between type inference and other aspects of code generation, which in turn depends strongly on the nature of the code: "type-heavy" code, such as this example, often seems to be dominated by inference, whereas "type-light" code (e.g., code that does a lot of numeric computation with just a few types and operations) tends to be dominated by other aspects of code generation.

While currently `precompile` can only save the time spent on type-inference, in the long run it may be hoped that Julia will also save the results from later stages of compilation.  If that happens, `precompile` will have even greater effect, and the savings will be less dependent on the balance between type-inference and other forms of code generation.

How does this magic work? During package precompilation, Julia creates a `*.ji` file typically stored in `.julia/compiled/v1.x/`, where `1.x` is your version of Julia.
Your `*.ji` file stores definitions of constants, types, and methods; this happens automatically while your package is being built.   Optionally (if you've used a `precompile` directive), you can also include the results of type-inference.

It might be natural to wonder, "how does `precompile` help? Doesn't it just shift the cost of compilation to the time when I load the package?" The answer is "no," because a `*.ji` file is not just a recording of all the steps you take when you define the module: instead, it's a snapshot of the *results* of those steps.  If you define a package

```
module PackageThatPrints

println("This prints only during precompilation")

function __init__()
    println("This prints every time the package is loaded")
end

end
```

you'll see that things that happen transiently do not "make it" into the precompile file; they have to be linked to constants, types, methods, and other durable code constructs.  (The `__init__` function is special in that it automatically gets called, if present, at the end of [module-loading].)  A `precompile` directive runs during precompilation but *not* when loading your code; it causes some additional information (the results of type-inference) to be written to the `*.ji` file, and when you use the package that information gets reloaded as well.  (Loading the results of type inference does take some time, but typically it's a fair bit quicker than computing it from scratch.)

Now that we've introduced the promise of `precompile`, it's time to acknowledge that this topic is complex.
How do you know how much of your latency is due to type-inference?
Moreover, even when type inference is the dominant source of latency, it turns out you can still find yourself in a circumstance where it is difficult to eliminate most of its cost.
In previous Julia versions, this fact has led to more than a little frustration using `precompile`.
One source of trouble was [invalidation], which frequently "spoiled" precompilation on earlier Julia versions, but that has been greatly improved (mostly behind-the-scenes, a.k.a. without package developers needing to do anything) in Julia 1.6.
The trickiest remaining problem is one of *code ownership*: where should the results of precompilation be stored?
When a bit of code requires methods from one package or library and types from another, how do you (or how does Julia) decide where to store the compiled code?

In this blog post, we take a big step backwards and start peering under the hood.  The goal is to understand why `precompile` sometimes has dramatic benefits, why sometimes it has nearly none at all, and how to rescue the situation when it fails.  To do that, we'll have to understand some of the "chain of dependencies" that link various bits of Julia code together.


## Type-inference, MethodInstances, and backedges

We'll introduce these concepts via a simple demo (users are encourage to try this and follow along).  First, let's open the Julia REPL and define the following methods:

```!
double(x::Real) = 2x
calldouble(container) = double(container[1])
calldouble2(container) = calldouble(container)
```

`calldouble2` calls `calldouble` which calls `double` on the first element in `container`. Let's create a `container` object and run this code:

```
julia> c64 = [1.0]
1-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0

julia> calldouble2(c64)    # running it compiles the methods for these types
2.0
```

Now, let's take a brief trip down to understand what Julia's compiler did when preparing to run that statement. It will be easiest to load the [MethodAnalysis] package:

```
julia> using MethodAnalysis

julia> mi = methodinstance(double, (Float64,))
MethodInstance for double(::Float64)
```

`methodinstance` is a lot like `which`, except it asks about *type-inferred code*.
We asked `methodinstance` to find an instance of `double` that had been inferred for a single `Float64` argument;
the fact that it returned a `MethodInstance`, rather than `nothing`,
indicates that this instance already existed--the method had already been inferred for this argument type.
If at this point you try `methodinstance(double, (Int,))`, you should get `nothing`, because we've never called `double` with an `Int` argument.

One of the crucial features of type-inference is that it keeps track of dependencies:

```
julia> using AbstractTrees

julia> print_tree(mi)
MethodInstance for double(::Float64)
└─ MethodInstance for calldouble(::Vector{Float64})
   └─ MethodInstance for calldouble2(::Vector{Float64})
```

This indicates that the result for type-inference on `calldouble2(::Vector{Float64})` depended on the result for `calldouble(::Vector{Float64})`, which in turn depended on `double(::Float64)`.
That should make sense: there is no way that Julia can know what type `calldouble2` returns unless it understands what its callees do.
This is our first example of a chain of dependencies that will be a crucial component of understanding how Julia decides where to stash the results of compilation.
In encoding this dependency chain, the callee (e.g., `double`) stores a link to the caller (e.g., `calldouble`); as a consequence, these links are typically called *backedges*.

This topic is more subtle than it may seem at first glance.
First, note that currently these are the only inferred instances of these methods:

```
julia> methodinstances(double)
1-element Vector{Core.MethodInstance}:
 MethodInstance for double(::Float64)

julia> methodinstances(calldouble)
1-element Vector{Core.MethodInstance}:
 MethodInstance for calldouble(::Vector{Float64})

julia> methodinstances(calldouble2)
1-element Vector{Core.MethodInstance}:
 MethodInstance for calldouble2(::Vector{Float64})
```

Let's change that: let's create a new container, but in a twist this time we'll use one with abstract element type, so that Julia's type-inference cannot accurately predict the type of elements in the container.  The element type of our container will be `AbstractFloat`, an abstract type with several subtypes; every actual instance has to have a concrete type, and just to make sure it's a new type (triggering new compilation) we'll use `Float32`:

```
julia> cabs = AbstractFloat[1.0f0]   # store a `Float32` inside a `Vector{AbstractFloat}`
1-element Vector{AbstractFloat}:
 1.0f0

julia> calldouble2(cabs)             # compile for these new types
2.0f0
```

Now let's look at the available instances:

```
julia> mis = methodinstances(double)
3-element Vector{Core.MethodInstance}:
 MethodInstance for double(::Float64)
 MethodInstance for double(::AbstractFloat)
 MethodInstance for double(::Float32)
```

We see that there are not two but three type-inferred instances of `double`: one for `Float64`, one for `Float32`, and one for `AbstractFloat`. Let's check the backedges of each:

```
julia> print_tree(mis[1])
MethodInstance for double(::Float64)
└─ MethodInstance for calldouble(::Vector{Float64})
   └─ MethodInstance for calldouble2(::Vector{Float64})

julia> print_tree(mis[2])
MethodInstance for double(::AbstractFloat)

julia> print_tree(mis[3])
MethodInstance for double(::Float32)
```

Why does the first have backedges to `calldouble` and `calldouble2`, but the second two do not?
Moreover, why does every instance of `calldouble` have backedges to `calldouble2`?

```
julia> mis = methodinstances(calldouble)
2-element Vector{Core.MethodInstance}:
 MethodInstance for calldouble(::Vector{Float64})
 MethodInstance for calldouble(::Vector{AbstractFloat})

julia> print_tree(mis[1])
MethodInstance for calldouble(::Vector{Float64})
└─ MethodInstance for calldouble2(::Vector{Float64})

julia> print_tree(mis[2])
MethodInstance for calldouble(::Vector{AbstractFloat})
└─ MethodInstance for calldouble2(::Vector{AbstractFloat})
```

despite the fact that the second is for `Vector{AbstractFloat}`?
The results here reflect the success or failure of concrete type-inference.
`AbstractFloat` is not a concrete type:

```
julia> isconcretetype(Float32)
true

julia> isconcretetype(AbstractFloat)
false
```

It may surprise some readers that `Vector{AbstractFloat}` is concrete:

```
julia> isconcretetype(Vector{Float32})
true

julia> isconcretetype(Vector{AbstractFloat})
true
```

The *container* is concrete even if the *elements* are not.
(Exercise for the reader: what about `AbstractVector{AbstractFloat}`? How about `AbstractVector{Float32}`?)

To look more deeply into the implications of concreteness and inference, a useful tool is `@code_warntype`.
You can see difference between `c64` and `cabs`, especially if you run this in the REPL yourself where you can see the red highlighting:

```julia
julia> @code_warntype calldouble2(c64)
Variables
  #self#::Core.Const(calldouble2)
  container::Vector{Float64}

Body::Float64
1 ─ %1 = Main.calldouble(container)::Float64
└──      return %1

julia> @code_warntype calldouble2(cabs)
Variables
  #self#::Core.Const(calldouble2)
  container::Vector{AbstractFloat}

Body::Any
1 ─ %1 = Main.calldouble(container)::Any
└──      return %1
```

Note that only the return type (`::Float64` vs `::Any`) differs between these; this is what accounts for the fact that `calldouble` has backedges to `calldouble2` in both cases, because in both cases the specific caller/callee chain can be successfully inferred.
The really big differences emerge one level lower:

```julia
julia> @code_warntype calldouble(c64)
Variables
  #self#::Core.Const(calldouble)
  container::Vector{Float64}

Body::Float64
1 ─ %1 = Base.getindex(container, 1)::Float64
│   %2 = Main.double(%1)::Float64
└──      return %2

julia> @code_warntype calldouble(cabs)
Variables
  #self#::Core.Const(calldouble)
  container::Vector{AbstractFloat}

Body::Any
1 ─ %1 = Base.getindex(container, 1)::AbstractFloat
│   %2 = Main.double(%1)::Any
└──      return %2
```

In the first case, `getindex` was guaranteed to return a `Float64`, but in the second case it's only known to be an `AbstractFloat`.
Moreover, type-inference cannot predict a concrete type for the return of `double(::AbstractFloat)`, though it can for `double(::Float64)`.
Consequently the call with `::AbstractFloat` is made via *runtime dispatch*, where execution pauses, Julia asks for the concrete type of the object, and then it makes the appropriate call to `double` (in this case, to `double(::Float32)`).

For completeness, what happens if we add another container with concrete eltype?

```
julia> c32 = [1.0f0]
1-element Vector{Float32}:
 1.0

julia> calldouble2(c32)
2.0f0

julia> mis = methodinstances(double)
3-element Vector{Core.MethodInstance}:
 MethodInstance for double(::Float64)
 MethodInstance for double(::AbstractFloat)
 MethodInstance for double(::Float32)

julia> print_tree(mis[1])
MethodInstance for double(::Float64)
└─ MethodInstance for calldouble(::Vector{Float64})
   └─ MethodInstance for calldouble2(::Vector{Float64})

julia> print_tree(mis[2])
MethodInstance for double(::AbstractFloat)

julia> print_tree(mis[3])
MethodInstance for double(::Float32)
└─ MethodInstance for calldouble(::Vector{Float32})
   └─ MethodInstance for calldouble2(::Vector{Float32})
```

So now both concretely-inferred versions of `double` link all the way back to `calldouble2`, but only when the element type of the container is also concrete.  A single `MethodInstance` may be called by multiple `MethodInstance`s (generally the set of backedges forms a graph, not just an unbranched chain), but most commonly a backedge is created only when the call can be inferred.

### Exercise for the reader

Does Julia ever compile methods, and introduce backedges, for abstract types? Start a fresh session, and instead of using the definitions above define `double` using [`@nospecialize`] :

```julia
double(@nospecialize(x::Real)) = 2x
```

Now compare what kind of backedges you get with `c64` and `cabs`.
It may be most informative to quit your session and start fresh between trying these two different container types.
You'll see that Julia is quite the opportunist when it comes to specialization!

## Precompilation and backedges

Let's turn the example above into a package:

```
(@v1.6) pkg> generate BackedgeDemo
  Generating  project BackedgeDemo:
    BackedgeDemo/Project.toml
    BackedgeDemo/src/BackedgeDemo.jl

julia> open("BackedgeDemo/src/BackedgeDemo.jl", "w") do io
           write(io, """
           module BackedgeDemo

           double(x::Real) = 2x
           calldouble(container) = double(container[1])
           calldouble2(container) = calldouble(container)

           precompile(calldouble2, (Vector{Float32},))
           precompile(calldouble2, (Vector{Float64},))
           precompile(calldouble2, (Vector{AbstractFloat},))

           end
           """)
       end
282
```

You can see we created a package, defined those three methods, and added three `precompile` directives, all for the top-level `calldouble2`. We did *not* add any explicit `precompile` directives for its callees `calldouble`, `double`, or anything needed by `double` (like `*` to implement `2*x`).

Now let's load this package and see if we have any `MethodInstance`s:

```
julia> push!(LOAD_PATH, "BackedgeDemo/")
4-element Vector{String}:
 "@"
 "@v#.#"
 "@stdlib"
 "BackedgeDemo/"

julia> using BackedgeDemo
[ Info: Precompiling BackedgeDemo [44c70eed-03a3-46c0-8383-afc033fb6a27]

julia> using MethodAnalysis

julia> methodinstances(BackedgeDemo.double)
3-element Vector{Core.MethodInstance}:
 MethodInstance for double(::Float32)
 MethodInstance for double(::Float64)
 MethodInstance for double(::AbstractFloat)
```

You can also verify that the same backedges get created as when we ran this code interactively above.  We have successfully saved the results of type inference.

This code got cached in `BackedgeDemo.ji`.
It's worth noting that even though the `precompile` directive got issued from this package, `MethodInstances` for methods defined in other packages or libraries can be saved as well.
For example, Julia does not come pre-built with the inferred code for `Int * Float32`: in a fresh session,

```
julia> using MethodAnalysis

julia> mi = methodinstance(*, (Int, Float32))

```
returns `nothing` (the `MethodInstance` doesn't exist), whereas if we've loaded `BackedgeDemo` then

```
julia> mi = methodinstance(*, (Int, Float32))
MethodInstance for *(::Int64, ::Float32)

julia> mi.def        # what Method is this MethodInstance from?
*(x::Number, y::Number) in Base at promotion.jl:322
```

So even though the method is defined in `Base`, because `BackedgeDemo` needed this type-inferred code it got stashed in `BackedgeDemo.ji`.

This is fantastic, but there are *significant limitations* to this ability to stash `MethodInstance`s from other modules.  Most crucially, `*.ji` files can only hold code they "own," either:

- for a method defined in the package
- through a chain of backedges to methods defined by the package

If we add

```julia
precompile(*, (Int, Float16))
```

to the definition of `BackedgeDemo.jl`, start a fresh session, and reload the package, you'll see it's completely ineffective:

```julia
julia> mi = methodinstance(*, (Int, Float16))
                                               # nothing
```

This happens because there is no "chain of ownership" to `BackedgeDemo`.
Consequently, we can't precompile methods defined in other modules in and of themselves; we can only do it if those methods are linked by backedges to this package.

### Time for a quiz!

Add a new type to `BackedgeDemo`:

```
export SCDType
struct SCDType end
```

and a precompile directive for `Base.push!`:

```
precompile(push!, (Vector{SCDType}, SCDType))
```

Now load the package and check whether the corresponding `MethodInstance` exists. If not, can you think of a way to get that `MethodInstance` added to the `*.ji` file? (*Answer is at the bottom of this post*)


### Synonyms for `precompile`

`precompile` can also be passed a complete `Tuple`-type: `precompile(calldouble2, (Vector{AbstractFloat},))` can alternatively be written

```
precompile(Tuple{typeof(calldouble2), Vector{AbstractFloat}})
```

This form appears frequently if `precompile` directives are issued by code that inspects `MethodInstance`s, because this signature is in the `specType` field of a `MethodInstance`:

```
julia> mi = methodinstance(BackedgeDemo.double, (AbstractFloat,))
MethodInstance for double(::AbstractFloat)

julia> mi.specTypes
Tuple{typeof(BackedgeDemo.double), AbstractFloat}
```

### Gotchas for `precompile`

One thing we also haven't discussed is that when `precompile` fails, it does so "almost" silently:

```julia
julia> methods(double)
# 1 method for generic function "double":
[1] double(x::Real) in BackedgeDemo at /tmp/BackedgeDemo/src/BackedgeDemo.jl:3

julia> precompile(double, (String,))
false
```

Even though `double` can't be compiled for `String`, the corresponding `precompile` doesn't error, it only returns `false`.
If you want to monitor the utility of your `precompile` directives, sometimes it's useful to preface them with `@assert`; all's well if precompilation succeeds, but if changes to the package mean that the precompile directive has "gone bad," then you get an error.
Hopefully, such errors would be caught before shipping the package to users!


## Summary

In this tutorial, we've learned about `MethodInstance`s, backedges, inference, and precompilation.
Some important take-home messages are:

- you can store the results of type-inference with explicit `precompile` directives
- to be useful, `precompile` has to be able to establish a chain of ownership to some package
- chains-of-ownership are bigger and more complete when type-inference succeeds

An important conclusion is that *precompilation works better when type inference succeeds.*
For some packages, time invested in improving inferrability can make your `precompile` directives work better.

## Looking ahead

Future installments will focus on describing some powerful new tools:

- tools to measure how inference is spending its time
- tools to help make decisions about (de)specialization
- tools to detect and fix inference failures
- tools to generate effective `precompile` directives

Stay tuned!

### Answer to quiz

Directly precompiling `push!(::Vector{SCDType}, ::SCDType)` fails, because while your package "owns" `SCDType`, *it does not own the method of `push!`*.

However, if you add a method that calls `push!` and then precompile it,

```
dopush() = push!(SCDType[], SCDType())
precompile(dopush, ())
```

then the `MethodInstance` for `push!(::Vector{SCDType}, ::SCDType)` will be added to the package through the backedge to `dopush` (which you do own).

This was a pretty artifical example, but in more typical cases this happens organically through the functionality of your package.
But, this only works when the call is inferrable.
